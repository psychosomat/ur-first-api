## About

**UR FIRST API** is designed as a practical, hands-on guide â€” not a reference tome. The goal is to get you building and experimenting with real API projects as fast as possible, while keeping explanations clear and approachable.

The tone is friendly and future-oriented: expect small working examples, end-to-end flows, and tips that help you move from "reading" to "shipping".
